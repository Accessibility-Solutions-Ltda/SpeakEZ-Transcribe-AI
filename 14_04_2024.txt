23:54:12: Welcome to the future, or should I say, welcome to Wuhan, China. Let's go! This is crazy, the taxi is driving by itself; there's no one in the seat, there's no one there. Now, I have shown you guys China's insane
23:54:37: infrastructure. They're mega airports, crazy bridges, the high-speed rail, and more. Right, so China is at it again. I'm here to show you China's new suspended monorail here in Wuhan. Let's go. This is the start of the line at
23:55:02: Feng Shan station. There are totally six stations along this line, and I'm getting kind of excited now because this is my first time ever on a monorail. Right, so let's buy the ticket. They also very conveniently have English language options for me, right? So, we buy the ticket here. And you can also set up facial recognition.
23:55:28: Uh, so let's set that up right now. We're gonna get a one-way ticket for RMB, okay? And next, okay, well, you can see me there, okay? There I am, in all my glory. Right, and then obviously, mobile payment. I'm gonna use our phone; we don't have to mess about with cash and coins like in the West.
